### Install dependencies
It is recommended to create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```bash 
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On Unix or Unix-like systems
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (may not finish on windows because of hypercorn)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Other requirements
- A PostgreSQL database
- A Redis database

### Configure the environment
Rename `.env_template` to `.env` and fill in the appropriate credentials.

### Running the server
On Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS):
```bash
source start.sh [-<process manager abbreviation> | --<process manager>]
```
> Check `source start.sh --help` for all the available process managers

On Windows:
```bash
uvicorn App:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

> [!Note] 
> It is recommended to run the system on Unix-like systems for stability and for more control over it. 
> In both cases, the API will listen to every IPv4 address available to the host on port 8000. To change that,
> you can use a specific IPv4 address instead of 0.0.0.0. You can also change the port it listens to, 
> but remember to also change it on the frontend, if you're using it.
